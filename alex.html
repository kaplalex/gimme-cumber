							<p> humans are animals. speciesism is the discrimination of a life-form which assumes that one species is superior to another. </p>
							<!-- scientific evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that most complex non-human animals feel pain in ways similar to the way a human experiences pain. non-human animals are still believed to be incapable of coping mechanisms that reduce the experience of suffering in relation to pain. the scale and magnitude of animals feeling pain due to factory farming is great (billions of lives). it is possible to reduce individual contribution towards factory farming by substituting some calories normally obtained from animal products with a balanced assortment of plant-based foods. </p> -->
							<p> reduce, reuse, recycle, refuse, repair. implementing these practices more often likely increases the amount of time earth has to find more effective strategies of combating climate change.</p>
								<!-- climate change is a complex and important issue to which there is currently not a definitive answer as to how an individual can make a significant positive impact and on which progress must be made to reduce the risk of an exponential increase in the amount of suffering experienced on earth. reducing, reusing, recycling, repairing, and refusing are still simple and effective strategies for societies to implement to at least slow the rate of destruction and allow more time for other solutions to be implemented. also, there is still an opportunity for a person or group of persons to discover a significant way to contribute. <p> -->
